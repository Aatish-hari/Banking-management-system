# Banking-management-system

A simple console-based banking system in C++ that allows users to create accounts, deposit/withdraw money, and view account info. Data is stored using file handling, and each account gets a random 4-digit number.

this project was only for my understanding on file handeling

Iâ€™m planning to improve it by adding features like login authentication, better error handling, and maybe even a database , json.
